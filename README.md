# MeetingsManagement
This is meeting management file which will allow users to register and check in for meetings.
I have used Firebase NOSQL Database to store the data about these meetings.
Also tried some Angular animations.

this is not a very big project, but just enough to learn the basic concepts and capabilities of angular.

(I did a course on lynda dot com and followed the course to build this project)

technologies used: AngularJS, Firebase, Bootstrap
